## IFNULL FUNCTION
In MySQL, the IFNULL function is used to handle NULL values. It takes two arguments: the first argument is the expression to be checked for NULL, and the second argument is the value to be returned if the first argument is NULL. If the first argument is not NULL, then the IFNULL function simply returns the value of the first argument.

Here's the general syntax of the IFNULL function:
`IFNULL(expression, value_if_null)`

- expression: The expression to be checked for NULL.
- value_if_null: The value to be returned if the expression is NULL.

## MORE IMPORTANT POINTS REGARDING IFNULL FUNCTION()
1. _Compatibility with COALESCE:_
The IFNULL function is specific to MySQL, and it serves the same purpose as the more general COALESCE function. Both functions are used to handle NULL values by returning an alternative value. The key difference is that COALESCE can take multiple arguments, whereas IFNULL can only take two.

EXAMPLE
```
SELECT product_id, COALESCE(price, 0) AS adjusted_price
FROM Prices;
```

2. _Data Types:_
It's important to note that the IFNULL function returns a value with the same data type as the first non-NULL argument. If the data types of the first argument and the specified default value differ, MySQL will perform implicit type conversion.
