## SOLVING QUESTION WITHOOUT USING SELF JOIN AND QUERY REMAINS SIMILAR 
- This is done by calling the same table twice and calculating as column:

Checkout question number 1661 on leetcode:

The two ways used to solve the question are:
1. Using JOINS:
```
SELECT 
    a.machine_id,
    ROUND(AVG(b.timestamp- a.timestamp), 3) AS processing_time
FROM 
    Activity a
JOIN 
    Activity b ON a.machine_id = b.machine_id 
                AND a.process_id = b.process_id 
                AND a.activity_type = 'start'
                AND b.activity_type = 'end'
GROUP BY 
    a.machine_id;
```

2. Without using JOINS:
```
SELECT a.machine_id, 
       ROUND(AVG(b.timestamp - a.timestamp), 3) AS processing_time
FROM Activity a, 
     Activity b
WHERE 
    a.machine_id = b.machine_id
AND 
    a.process_id = b.process_id
AND 
    a.activity_type = 'start'
AND 
    b.activity_type = 'end'
GROUP BY machine_id
```
