## ENUM DATATYPE (ENUMERATION)
In MySQL, an `ENUM` (enumeration) is a data type that represents a set of predefined values. An ENUM column can store one of the specified values, and the values must be defined at the time of table creation. Each value in the `ENUM` type is assigned an index starting from 1.

Here's the basic syntax for defining an ENUM column:
`ENUM('value1', 'value2', 'value3', ...)`

EXAMPLE:
you might define an ENUM column for a "status" field that can have values 'active', 'inactive', and 'pending':
```
CREATE TABLE ExampleTable (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    status ENUM('active', 'inactive', 'pending')
);
```

Some key points about ENUM data type:

1. _Ordinal Indexing_:Each value in the ENUM type is assigned an ordinal index starting from 1. The index corresponds to the position of the value in the list.
2. _Storage Efficiency_:ENUM values are stored as integers internally, which can be more space-efficient than storing string values.
3. _Readability_:ENUM provides a way to make the data more readable by using descriptive string values instead of arbitrary numeric codes.
4. _Limitations_:The set of possible values is fixed at the time of table creation. If you need to add or remove values, you might need to alter the table, which could be less flexible than using other data types or normalization techniques.
