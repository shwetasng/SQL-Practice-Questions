## ROUND() FUNCTION

The ROUND() function in MySQL is used to round a numeric value to a specified number of decimal places. It is commonly used to control the precision of floating-point numbers. The basic syntax of the ROUND() function is as follows:`ROUND(number, [decimals])`

- number: The numeric value that you want to round.
- [decimals]: The number of decimal places to round to. If omitted, it defaults to 0.

EXAMPLE:
```
Round to the Nearest Integer:
SELECT ROUND(12.345);  -- Result: 12
SELECT ROUND(12.789);  -- Result: 13

Round with Specified Decimal Places:
SELECT ROUND(123.4567, 2);  -- Result: 123.46
SELECT ROUND(987.6543, 1);  -- Result: 987.7

Negative Decimal Places (Round to Tens, Hundreds, etc.):
SELECT ROUND(1234.5678, -1);  -- Result: 1230
SELECT ROUND(9876.5432, -2);  -- Result: 9900

Using in Aggregate Functions:
SELECT AVG(ROUND(price, 2)) AS avg_price
FROM products;
```

NOTE: Keep in mind that rounding can introduce potential inaccuracies, especially when working with floating-point numbers. It's important to understand the precision requirements of your application and use the ROUND() function judiciously to meet those requirements.
