## LENGTH() Function in Mysql

You can use the LENGTH() function to calculate the length of a VARCHAR column. The LENGTH() function returns the length of a string in bytes, not characters.
```
-- Length in bytes
SELECT LENGTH(column_name) AS length_in_bytes
FROM your_table;
```

If you want the length in characters, you can use the CHAR_LENGTH() function instead.
```
-- Length in characters
SELECT CHAR_LENGTH(column_name) AS length_in_characters
FROM your_table;
```
NOTE: Keep in mind that if your VARCHAR column contains multibyte characters (e.g., UTF-8 encoded text), the length in bytes may not be the same as the length in characters. In such cases, using CHAR_LENGTH() is more appropriate for character count.
