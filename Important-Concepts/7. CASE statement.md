## CASE STATEMENT
- The CASE statement is a conditional expression in SQL that allows you to perform conditional logic within a query.
- It has two forms: simple and searched. The searched form is used in this query.
- The syntax is: `CASE WHEN condition THEN result ELSE else_result END.`

## USE OF CASE STATEMENT WITH SUM FUNCTION:
- The combination of CASE and SUM allows you to perform conditional counting, which is useful when you want to count occurrences based on specific conditions in your dataset.
- Using SUM with CASE WHEN allows you to perform conditional summation in SQL. It’s particularly useful when you want to aggregate values based on specific conditions. Consider it the equivalent of “pivoting” data - combining multiple rows by category and an aggregate function.
